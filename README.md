# Webpage_To_PDF
(first ever personal project)

**I have no idea how any of this works. I have never used javascript before.
Almost everything was written by GPT-4 so I am not responsible for the bad code (this is a joke, I am responsible if this blows up your computer).**


Known Bugs:
- Sometimes downloads two pdfs for some reason

Improvements:
- Better GUI
- Ability to work for more websites
- Have some basic customisation settings in the popup
- Have a settings page for better customisation
- Add a link to the github from the extension

Other things to do:
- Upload to Chrome store
- understand how the code works
- Get better icons
